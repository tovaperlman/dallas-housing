# Progress Report - Week 2

This is a progress report for week 2 of MUSA 801 - Dallas Housing. 

Authors: Tyler Bradford, Al-Jalil Gault, Tova Perlman

## 1. Use Case

We plan to follow the trajectory of racial demographic groups and people who recidivate in our dataset to see if there is a disparity in ways people are flowing through the system. We will then use this information to build a model that prioritizes who needs early interventions. We also hope to model total demand for permanent housing services. We want to look at the total people receiving homelessness services and see who finds unsubsidized private housing, who can obtain subsidized private housing, and who gets permanent public housing.


## 2. Purpose of Exploratory Analysis

We are looking at various demographic segments within our population to note the patterns and ways in which different groups make use of the system. While our primary focus is race and recidivism, we are also looking at gender and disabling condition within program type and housing services to create an understanding of who uses what service and to what extent. We have built alluvial plots and bar charts that display this information.


## 3. Team Roles

We have assigned team roles according to sections of the project. Because we are a small team, we imagine that everyone will be involved in some capacity with each section of the project. To reflect this, we have outlined **Leads** and **Supports** for each section of the project. The Lead will be responsible for outlining the project plan for that section, and has an established expertise in the required skillset. The Support will be the other primary contibutor to that section of the project and is either already capable in the relevant skillset or has expressed a desire to expand that skillset during the semester.

## 4. Gantt Chart

Below is a Gantt chart outlining when we will work on each section of the project. This timeline is subject to change as we progress through the project and will be subsequently broken out in the individual tasks that will be assigned to individual team members.
