## 1. Use Case

## 2. Exploratory Analysis Questions

## 3. Team Roles

We have assigned team roles according to sections of the project. Because we are a small team, we imagine that everyone will be involved in some capacity with each section of the project. To reflect this, we have outlined **Leads** and **Supports** for each section of the project. The Lead will be responsible for outlining the project plan for that section, and has an established expertise in the required skillset. The Support will be the other primary contibutor to that section of the project and is either already capable in the relevant skillset or has expressed a desire to expand that skillset during the semester.  

| Project Area      | Lead | Support |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------|
| Domain Research      | Tova       | All |
| Use Case Refinement   | Tova        | All| 
| Data Wrangling      | Tyler       | Tova |
| EDA   | Tyler        | All| 
| Modeling      | Tyler       | Tova |
| App Infrastructure   | Al-Jalil        | Tyler|
